# PERN TodoList

## Project summary

To-do list realised with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, NodeJS) thanks to Freecodecamp (link below).
Allowed me to deepen my understanding of these technologies, as well as http requests, asynchronous javascript, and the whole structure of a project.
Next step will be to learn how to deploy it (on my raspberry pi and on hosting services).

<strong> Big thank you to Henry for this clear, complete tutorial<strong/>
